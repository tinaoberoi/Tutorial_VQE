    "\n",
    "## What are eigen values?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you multiply a matrix with a vector, the vector rotates + scales. If there exists a vector whoch when multiplied to matrix would only cause the scaling effect but no rotation, that vector is the eigen vector. And corresponding scaling value is the eigen value.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why do we need the lowest energy values?\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest energy provides valuable information about the properties of the system which can further be utilised to understand the system, make predictions and exploit this information for further research."
