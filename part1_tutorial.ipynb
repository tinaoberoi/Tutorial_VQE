    "\n",
    "Here the Hamiltonian operator  $\\hat H$ of a quantum system represents the total energy of that system. The Hamiltonian is a matrix and the eigenvalues of that matrix represent possible energy values that the system vcan take on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are eigen values?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you multiply a matrix with a vector, the vector rotates + scales. If there exists a vector whoch when multiplied to matrix would only cause the scaling effect but no rotation, that vector is the eigen vector. And corresponding scaling value is the eigen value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know that Hamiltonian represents the energy of the system we can use this information to reach the ground state or the lowest energy of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need the lowest energy values?\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest energy provides valuable information about the properties of the system which can further be utilised to understand the system, make predictions and exploit this information for further research."
