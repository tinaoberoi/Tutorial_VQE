    "## Concept1 : Matrix exponential\n",
    " For matrix M\n",
    "$$ \n",
    " e^M  = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!} M^k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And for Pauli Matrix Z, X, and Y\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " e^{i\\theta X} = R_X(2\\theta) = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n",
    "    \\cos (\\theta) & -i\\sin (\\theta)\\\\\n",
    "   -i\\sin (\\theta) & \\cos (\\theta)\n",
    "    \\end{array}\\right)\n",

    "## Concept3: Adiabatic Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen in part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(\\mathbf{x},t) = \\hat H \\Psi(\\mathbf{x},t)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Adiabatic Theorem states that if a hamiltonian is in its ground state and is changed slowly enough, the system remains in ground state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Troterization:\n",
    "\n",
    "For commuting matrices A and B $e^(A+B) = e^A e^B$ But for general case\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{-i(H_1+H_2)t} \\approx  (e^{-iH_1\\frac{t}{r}}e^{-iH_2\\frac{t}{r}})^r\n",

    "## Finally! QAOA as Adiabatic process\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(t) = \\frac{t}{T}H_c + (1-\\frac{t}{T})H_m\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see at $t = 0$ Initial QAOA is the highest energy state of $H_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "And as t increases we approach $H_c$, and if we do this transition slowly eniugh then if we start at the ground state of mixer we reach ground state of $H_c$. And this is true for higher energy values as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if we start with the highest energy state of the $H_m$ we will adiabatically reach the highest energy state of $H_c$\n",

    "## Problems with this implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance and Efficiency is guaranteed as $p \\rightarrow \\infty $</li>\n",
    "- As we are increasing p we increase the hilbert space that our trial state lives in.\n",
    "- No guarantee for finite p\n",
