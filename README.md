# Tutorial on Variational Quantum EigenSolvers

`If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough - Albert Einstein`

This project is an effort to create an easy to understand tutorial on Varaitional quantum eigen solvers. 
The tutorial used fifferent sources to create a consolidated learning resources with all answers.

The tutorial is divided into two parts
- [Part1](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part1_tutorial.ipynb) : Discussion starts from `Schrodinger Equation` to Significance of `Hamiltonian`.
- [Part2](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part2_tutorial.ipynb): Dicussion starts from `VQA` to Steps involved in solving problems using `VQE`.
- [Part3](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part3_tutorial.ipynb): This includes a code implementation of a defined problem statement

If you have any suggestions to improve this repo please submit a pull request. 
Lets make learning about `quantum` easy and less intimidating.
