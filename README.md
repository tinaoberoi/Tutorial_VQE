# Tutorial on Variational Quantum EigenSolvers

`If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough - Albert Einstein`
This project is an effort to create an easy to understand tutorial on Varaitional quantum eigen solvers. 
The tutorial used fifferent sources to create a consolidated learning resources with all answers.

The tutorial is divided into two parts
- Part1 : Discussion starts from `Schrodinger Equation` to Significance of `Hamiltonian`.
- Part2: Dicussion starts from `VQA` to Steps involved in solving problems using `VQE`.
- Part3: This includes a code implementation of a defined problem statement

If you have any suggestions to improve this repo please submit a pull request. 
Lets make learning about `quantum` easy and less intimidating.
