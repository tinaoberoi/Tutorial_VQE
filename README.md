# Tutorial on Variational Quantum EigenSolvers

`If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough - Albert Einstein`

This project is an effort to create an easy to understand tutorial on Varaitional quantum eigen solvers. 
The tutorial used fifferent sources to create a consolidated learning resources with all answers.

The tutorial is a seven part series
- [Part1](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part1_tutorial.ipynb) : Discussion starts from `Schrodinger Equation` to Significance of `Hamiltonian`.
- [Part2](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part2_tutorial.ipynb): Dicussion starts from `VQA` to Steps involved in solving problems using `VQE`.
- [Part3](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part3_tutorial.ipynb): This includes a code implementation of a defined problem statement
- [Part4](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part4_tutorial.ipynb): This includes explaination about `QUBO` problems and how NP hard problems like MaxCut can be represented as a QUBO problem. This also includes how we can find Hamiltonian cost function of QUBO problems.
- [Part5](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part5_tutorial.ipynb): This includes neccessary concepts about `QAOA` implementation and explaination about adiabatic QAOA.
- [Part6](https://github.com/tinaoberoi/Tutorial_VQE/blob/main/part6_tutorial.ipynb): This includes the implementation of using `QAOA` to solve maxcut problem.
  
If you have any suggestions to improve this repo please submit a pull request. 
Lets make learning about `quantum` easy and less intimidating.
